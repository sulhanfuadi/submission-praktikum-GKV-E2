<!-- ## Assignments Overview

### Pertemuan 1: OpenGL Installation

- Basic OpenGL setup and demonstration of 3D shapes
- Includes spinning wireframe and smooth shaded shapes

### Pertemuan 2: Primitive Drawing & Transformations

- Assignment 1: Solar System Simulation

  - Implementation of a small solar system with an orbiting planet
  - Demonstrates rotation transformation and animation

- Assignment 2: Car Animation
  - 2D car animation with day-night cycle
  - Advanced implementation with headlights, wheel rotation, and scene transitions -->

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- FreeGLUT and OpenGL libraries
- C++ development environment

### Compilation (Example)

```bash
g++ -o program main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

### Running

```bash
./program
```

## Controls

- For most programs:
  - Press `ESC` or `q` to exit
  - Use `+` and `-` keys to adjust detail in 3D models (where applicable)
